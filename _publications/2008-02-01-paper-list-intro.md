excerpt: 'Currently vast amounts of textual information exist in large repositories such as Web. To processes such a huge amount of information, automatic text summarization has been of great interests. Unlike many approaches which focus on sentence or paragraph extraction, in this research, we introduce a method to make extractions based on three factors of Readability, Cohesion and Topic relation. We use Harmony Search-based sentence selection to make such a summary. Once the summary is created, it is evaluated using a fitness function based on those three factors. The evaluation of the algorithm on a test collection is also presented in the paper. Our results indicate that the extracted summaries by our proposed scheme have better precision and recall than the other approaches.'
