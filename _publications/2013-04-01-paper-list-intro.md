excerpt: 'The possible combinations of features traditionally used for sentence similarity amount to a very large feature space. Considering all possible combinations and training a support vector machine on the resulting meta-features in a two step process significantly improves performance. The proposed method is trained and tested on the SemEval-2012 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Shared Task data, outperforming the taskâ€™s highest ranking system.'
